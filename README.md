# 🕹️ So_Long: A 2D Game Adventure 🏃‍♂️💨

Welcome to **So_Long**, a game inspired by Pac-Man, built using the **MiniLibX** library! 🎮 The player’s goal is simple: collect all the collectibles, find the exit, and escape as quickly as possible! ⏱️

## 🚀 Game Overview

In **So_Long**, you control a character navigating through a maze. Your task is to collect all the collectibles 🟡 and find the shortest route to escape 🚪. But beware—walls will block your way, and if you are playing the bonus version, enemies 👾 might patrol the area!

### 🎯 Objectives:
- Collect all the collectibles (🟡) scattered across the map.
- Escape through the exit (🚪) after collecting everything.
- Use **W, A, S, D** to move up, left, down, and right (or arrow keys if you prefer).
- Avoid walls (⬛) and enemies (👾 in the bonus version).
